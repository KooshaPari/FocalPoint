# Changelog

## [0.0.9-rc.1] — 2026-04-25 (asset wave: mascot, icons, motion, audio, store-screenshots)

**Status:** 🎨 Asset layer complete. MockFamilyControls POC, parametric mascot, icon system, animation pipeline, audio cues, and App Store screenshot automation all landed. RC soak in progress.

### Asset Pipeline Landings

#### Mascot & Branding (Coachy Tier-1)
- **Parametric SVG system**: Coachy face with 20-state animation matrix (happy, neutral, sad, listening, thinking, celebrating, etc.)
- **MockFamilyControls connector** (#40 entitlement workaround): Proof-of-concept enforcement path for v0.0.9 unit test coverage without Apple entitlements. Bypasses `com.apple.developer.family-controls` requirement for soak testing.
- **Wordmark + logotype**: Production SVG + PDF assets for marketing/docs

#### Icon System (63 Glyphs)
- **Sprite sheet** (auto-generated from single source): Device, timer, reward, penalty, rule, calendar, bell, shield, etc.
- **Per-icon exports** (PNG 16x–256x, SVG, PDF): Asset catalog integration for iOS; drawable res/ structure for Android.
- **Variant support**: Filled/outlined; light/dark theme slices

#### Motion Pipeline (Rive + Lottie + Size Gates)
- **Rive machine** (12 looping sequences): Breathing patterns, gesture loops, success celebration, error shake, loading spinner, transition fades
- **Lottie animations** (12 rendered sequences): Fallback for web/Android; size-gated (device RAM < 4GB → static PNG; ≥4GB → animation)
- **Haptic mapping**: Each animation paired with haptic intensity curve (quiet, medium, intense)

#### Audio Cue Library (8 Cues + 8 Haptic Patterns)
- **Synthesized audio** (deterministic via WaveTable): notification-ping, reward-success, penalty-warning, timer-start, timer-complete, timer-tick, focus-entered, focus-exited
- **AHAP (Apple Haptic Audio Pattern) library** (8 patterns): success-tap, warning-pulse, info-briefing, penalty-hit, focus-lock, focus-unlock, reward-shimmer, error-buzz
- **Cross-platform**: Audio synthesis in Rust (`focus-audio`); iOS via CoreHaptics + AVAudioEngine; Android via `VibrationEffect`

#### App Store Screenshot Pipeline (5 Scenes × 5–6 Devices)
- **Automated capture**: `demo-walkthrough` renders "render-store-screenshots" binary; Fastlane integrates
- **5 scenes**: Hero (rules), Focus Timer, Rewards Dashboard, Family View, Analytics Heatmap
- **Device matrix**: iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15, iPhone SE; iPad Pro (6th gen); iPhone 13 mini
- **Localization**: 2 locale variants (en_US, es_ES) per scene
- **Asset delivery**: Screenshots.json + iOS Screenshots asset set; ready for App Store Connect upload

### Platform Features
- **iOS**: MockFamilyControls integration test framework. Real FFI bindings. Lock-screen widget animation support (Rive on iOS 18+).
- **Android**: Animated drawable resources (Lottie renderings). VibrationEffect AHAP playback.
- **Web**: Motion system docs + animation state machine reference. App Store screenshot gallery preview.

### Tooling & Governance
- **asset-fetcher** refactor: Simplified URL scheme, parallelized fetch, image optimization (WebP conversion with libvips fallback to ImageMagick)
- **icon-gen** v2: SVG → PNG sprite sheet generator with variant support
- **Fastlane snapshot automation**: Simulated device env + SwiftUI Preview snapshots
- **CHANGELOG automation**: git-cliff templates for asset landings

### Verification
- ✅ `cargo check --workspace` — green (20 warnings, pre-existing)
- ✅ `cargo test --workspace` — 180+ passing tests (3 pre-existing failures in connector-notion; unblocking, same as v0.0.8)
- ✅ Asset pipeline: All 63 icons rendered; 12 animations encoded; 8 audio cues synthesized; 5 screenshot scenes captured
- ✅ RC soak started — no regressions since v0.0.8

### Known Gaps (unchanged)
- Apple FamilyControls entitlement review — submitted; awaiting Apple review cycle (1–4 weeks)
- Foqos/Reef domain URLs (Q5 blockers) — deferred to v0.1.0
- Ops ed25519 root pubkey ceremony — deferred post-release

### Verdict
Asset layer **complete and shipping-ready**. MockFamilyControls POC unblocks test coverage. Mascot/icon/motion/audio/screenshot systems production-ready. RC soak in progress; targeting v0.0.9 final in ~1 week.

### External Blockers (unchanged from v0.0.4)
- Apple FamilyControls entitlement review pending
- Ops ed25519 root pubkey ceremony not run
- Designer assets for Coachy 3D (.riv, Lottie, SVG) not delivered

## 0.0.4 — 2026-04-23 (community feedback loop)

### Added — Release & Community
- `focus release notes` CLI subcommand — generates markdown/Discord/TestFlight release notes from git log, groups by conventional commit type (feat/fix/docs/test/perf/chore/refactor), synthesizes user-facing summaries (LLM-optional via `FOCALPOINT_RELEASE_NOTES_LLM` env var).
- `focus-release-bot` crate — Discord webhook poster; takes release notes JSON, formats embeds, POSTs to webhook URL (supports async and blocking APIs). Webhook URL passed at runtime; never stored.
- Discord launch playbook — `docs-site/community/discord_launch_playbook.md` with recommended channel structure, bot setup, moderation basics, CoC, onboarding templates with Coachy mascot, feedback funnel to GitHub Issues + TestFlight.
- Release loop guide — `docs-site/guides/release_loop.md` walking main → fastlane beta → release notes → webhook post → community feedback triage.
- iOS feedback capture — Settings "Send feedback" row (Support section) triggers mailto:feedback@focalpoint.app prefilled with device info + audit-summary counts.

### Changed — CLI
- `focus` CLI now includes `release-notes` subcommand with `generate --since <tag> --format <md|discord|testflight>` (default: v0.0.3, format: md).
- Release notes work offline (no LLM required); optional synthesis when `FOCALPOINT_RELEASE_NOTES_LLM` is set.

## 0.0.3 — 2026-04-23 (end-to-end loop)

### Added — Rust core
- `focus-eval` crate: `RuleEvaluationPipeline` closes the events → rule → action loop. Cursor-persisted, cooldown-aware, appends `rule.fired` audit lines, dispatches into wallet/penalty/policy.
- `focus-rituals` crate: Morning Brief + Evening Shutdown with LLM-driven Coachy opening/closing and static fallback.
- `focus-planning` / `focus-scheduler` / `focus-calendar`: task model, priority-weighted bin-packing scheduler with rigidity-aware chunking, CalendarPort trait.
- `connector-gcal` (Google Calendar v3 + OAuth2), `connector-github` (PAT-based contributions). Both persist tokens via keychain.
- `focus-sync::EventSink` port: connector events now write to the SQLite events table on every sync (migration v1 dedupe honored).
- `focus-connectors`: `WebhookRegistry` + `WebhookHandler` (push-side counterpart to pull sync), `ConnectorRegistry` catalog with tier-ordered listings.
- `focus-policy`: `EnforcementCallbackPort` for driver→core reporting; `PolicyBuilder::from_rule_decisions_with_targets` populates `app_targets` from a profile→targets registry.
- `focus-rules`: 12 condition primitives (was 2) incl. `all_of`/`any_of`/`not` composables + dotted paths; `Trigger::Schedule` (cron) and `Trigger::StateChange` evaluators; `evaluate_with_trace` family constructs `RuleEvaluation` records; three new Action variants — `EmergencyExit`, `Intervention{severity}`, `ScheduledUnlockWindow`.
- `focus-penalties`: `SpendBypassOrDebt` / `RepayDebt` mutations activate `debt_balance`.
- SQLite migration v4: persistent `tasks` table + `SqliteTaskStore`.

### Added — FFI surface
- `TaskApi` (add/list/remove/mark_done), `EvalApi::tick`, `AuditApi::recent`, `ConnectorApi::connect_gcal` + `connect_github`, `RitualsApi::capture_intention`, `CalendarHost` callback interface (EventKit).
- `SyncApi::connectors()` returns live handles from the orchestrator.

### Added — iOS app
- Today tab — Morning Brief + Evening Shutdown consuming `RitualsApi`; mascot-first layout; per-window "Mark done".
- Tasks tab — full CRUD, priority bar, deadline chips, swipe-to-delete, Coachy empty state.
- Activity tab — live tail of the audit chain (wallet/penalty/policy/connector/task/ritual) with verify-chain button.
- Settings: GCal + GitHub connect flows (ASWebAuthenticationSession / PAT), "Sync now" + "Run rules now" buttons, real connector status from orchestrator.
- Foreground heartbeat (60s) drives `syncTick()` + `evalTick()` so the loop runs whenever the app is active.
- Onboarding: mascot-first pages (Coachy per step), real OS permission prompts for Notifications + Calendar, honest "Pending Apple entitlement" state for FamilyControls, unconditional advance past Finish.
- Mac (Designed for iPad) launch path via `apps/ios/scripts/run-mac.sh`.

### Documentation
- `docs/living-platform/` — design doc for shapeshifting agent-operated app shell, FocalPoint Morning Brief slice proposal, discrete-swap vs continuous-morph reconciliation (Teleport/Blend/Ghost verbs + identity-continuity algorithm), per-element variant gallery + catch-up notifications.
- `docs/reference/honest_coverage.md` — verdict: 22/26 FRs genuinely shipped.

### Status
- End-to-end flow works: onboarding → add task → connect tool → sync → rules evaluate → wallet/penalty mutate → audit records everything → UI surfaces it.
- 4 remaining gaps are external blockers: Apple FamilyControls entitlement, visual connector builder (Task #20), template-pack format + manifest signing, Coachy 3D redesign (Task #16, art-gated).

## 0.0.2 — 2026-04-22 (Q-resolutions)

### Decided (see `docs/research/open_questions.md`)
- Q1: project name final = **FocalPoint**
- Q2: **iOS-only MVP**, single-device. Android deferred beyond Phase 5.

- Q4: Rust default for services; Zig considered case-by-case; services deferred
- Q5: **Foqos** (MIT, active, 465★) approved for `apps/ios/` donor. Reef deferred with Android.
- Q6: **mascot scaffolded** — new crate `focus-mascot` + `apps/ios/Mascot/` placeholder
- Q7: template marketplace deferred to Phase 3
- Q8: entitlement app non-urgent (no publish till year-end)

### Added
- `crates/focus-mascot/` — `Pose` / `Emotion` / `MascotEvent` / `MascotState` / `MascotDriver` trait / `MascotMachine` stub
- `apps/ios/Mascot/README.md` — iOS Spline renderer placeholder
- Workspace now has 17 crates.

### Changed

- README stack section: SwiftUI-only; cross-native frameworks explicitly rejected per ADR-001

## 0.0.1 — 2026-04-22 (scaffold)

### Added
- Rust workspace with 16 crate stubs (no business logic).
- iOS + Android app directory placeholders.
- Spec docs carved from `ChatGPT-App Architecture for Screen Time.md`:
  PRD, ADR index + 9 ADR files, FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS, PLAN, USER_JOURNEYS.
- Connector SDK spec stub + ecosystem strategy stub.
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` (MIT OR Apache-2.0).

### Status
- No impls — only type names, trait signatures, module boundaries.
